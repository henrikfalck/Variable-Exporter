# Variable Documenter

*Variable Documenter* creates a table for documenting your Figma variables. It supports all the variable types in Figma, as well as aliases.

## Install

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/henrikfalck/Variable-Exporter.git
```

You'll need to run the plugin once before you can use it, so that the plugin builds the UI and code files.

```zsh
cd [your/path] && npm run build
```

You can now use the plugin as you wish inside of Figma.

## To-do
- Add a link from aliases to their respective variable
- Add a min-width on all columns
- See if a grid solution is better than flex
